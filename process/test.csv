6,0,"The Tokaimura accident raised public sensitivity to the potential dangers nuclear power can pose for public health, the environment, and international security"
6,0,"nuclear power makes up less than 20 percent of Germany's power consumption while the proportion of renewable energy has increased to more than 20 percent, making it obvious that nuclear power is being replaced by renewable energy"
6,1,China has maintained a good record in the safe operation of its nuclear facilities
6,0,the inclusion of nuclear energy in the list of the renewable sources of energy is actually the lethal nuclear waste that is emitted from the nuclear power reactors
6,1,Electricity produced through nuclear energy is considered the most viable method as there are environmental concerns in production of electricity by fossil fuels
6,0,These particles must be controlled or they would cause a dangerous explosion
6,1,Saudi Arabia is faced with a strong growth of electricity demand
6,1,"as a large-scale, nearly carbon-free energy source, it is one of the cheapest ways to reduce GHG emissions"
6,0,the use of nuclear power can be rather dangerous
6,1,The world now have recently faced serious air pollution and power shortage
6,1,a change has come with high and persistently high oil prices
6,1,"Nuclear energy is a viable, clean alternative that can help strengthen America's energy infrastructure now"
6,0,It is too dangerous and too expensive
6,1,China's excellent record in the safe operation and environmental protection of its nuclear plants over past years is a good testimony to its nuclear safety surveillance measures
6,1,"Even if uranium costs double, on the other hand, prices won't be reflected on energy bills"
6,1,"Radiation kills micro-organisms, bacteria, and other deadly things that could be in your food before it has been packaged"
6,0,"In the Chernobyl disaster, although the Soviet government put the number of deaths at 36, unofficial documents pointed to the fact that more than 5,000 people lost their lives as a result"
6,1,nuclear energy is helping to reduce nuclear weapons quantities in a safe and useful manner
6,0,"Wind power, solar power and wave power are being used very widely in other countries, so there is no need to build more nuclear power plants anywhere in the world"
6,0,Construction times can be between 4-8 years
6,0,the expertise required limits the number that can be built simultaneously
6,0,Nuclear fuel cycle utilises large quantities of fossil fuel
6,0,green activism may end up harming the environment and our health
6,1,a coal power plant needs to have trucks delivering coal to it on a daily basis while a nuclear power plant may have its fuel changed every two years
6,0,How many nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima do we need to be convinced that nuclear plants should be shut down
6,1,"nuclear power tend to work better than using fossil fuels, gas power, and hydroelectric power"
6,0,"Such demands on water resources are impractical, harm agriculture, and general raise water utility prices"
6,1,"it would be shortsighted to assume that fossil fuels, especially coal, are a profitable and sustainable energy source"
6,1,building and opening a nuclear power plant opens up many job opportunities
6,1,Uranium is a fairly abundant mineral
6,1,there is a lot more uranium available that will be discovered
6,1,Africa could build nuclear power plants to meet growing demands for energy
6,1,A decrease in prices
6,1,It is hard to find a good alternative to nuclear energy in countries like Korea that have no other energy sources
6,1,it is essential for an energy-poor Japan to efficiently use its uranium resources to maintain recycled indigenous plutonium sources for energy security
6,1,"the countries that have barred nuclear power from being produced in their respective countries will ultimately rely on nuclear power, albeit at a more expensive imported price"
6,1,Because of the excessive consumption of energy
6,0,risk and uncertainty make it difficult to control the financial and material costs of building nuclear power plants
6,0,"Nuclear power plants are expensive to build, prompting Wall Street to call new nuclear a ""bet the farm"" risk"
